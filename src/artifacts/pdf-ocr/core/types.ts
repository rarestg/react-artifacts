Transcribe this PDF page into clean markdown.

Rules:
- Preserve the visible text faithfully.
- Preserve headings, lists, paragraphs, and reading order.
- Convert tables into standard markdown tables with exactly one header row.
- If a complex table cannot be represented cleanly as one markdown table, split it into multiple titled tables.
- If the page contains important diagrams or visual callouts, describe them briefly in brackets.
- If the page is blank or has no useful text, return [Blank page].
- Return only the page transcription, with no preamble or commentary.`;
